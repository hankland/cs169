CS169, Iteration 4:

run "npm install" to install dependencies;
run "./sync.sh" to sync database;
run "npm start" to start application;

Testing:

run "npm test" to make Mocha run all tests in the 'test' directory;
run "make coverage" to obtain a code coverage report in coverage.html (you may need to install node-jscoverage from https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage and follow the instructions on the README first);
